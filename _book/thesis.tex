Relationships between geographic areas can be communicated using maps. The speed of visual processes allow quick comparisons to be made between neighbouring areas. However, when presenting population-related statistics on the geographic map base, large areas that draw readers' attention can allow too much emphasis to be placed on sparsely populated rural areas.
This problem can dramatically impact the interpretation of statistics across Australia, due to the large difference in the land area when the population is concentrated in a few small areas.

In this thesis a new algorithm for laying out spatial areas into a tessellated hexgon tile is developed. This layout is used to create a new visualisation method for displaying disease data for Australia.
An experiment was conducted that indicates that this visualisation outperforms the traditional choropleth map for communicating disease data.
A software implementation was generated and made publicly available for others to use these techniques. In addition, animation can be used to translate from the choropleth map to the new tessellated hexagon display to help viewers interpret the new display.

\hypertarget{ch:intro}{%
\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro}}

Maps can contribute to the interpretation of spatial distributions of disease occurrence, and help to locate disease clusters. Disease data is commonly aggravated to political areas. privacy is one reason for this and another is the responsibility of the political entity to respond. The typical visualisation for aggregated spatial data is a choropleth map, where areas are coloured according to a numerical value. A choropleth map is the most common display for the presentation of geospatial data.

Choropleth maps do a disservice to the map reader, as the attention of the map user is distributed according to the size of the area. Using a choropleth map to get a broad perspective of Australia can be misleading, when the size of geographical areas misrepresent the spatial distribution of a dataset. This representation is not practical if each area is considered equally important. In Australia, the population is not equally dispersed across the geographic map base.
Instead, the communities are densely populated in the inner city areas, especially around the capital cities. There are several visualisation methods that have been developed to emphasise the population dense areas. These alternatives should be considered when planning the communication of geospatial statistics, as visualisations should be chosen to best represent the spatial distribution. This work is motivated by the Australian Cancer Atlas, which presents the spatial patterns of cancer in Australia. The aim of this thesis is to contribute an algorithm that creates effective visualisations for the communication of geospatial population statistics.

\hypertarget{the-australian-cancer-atlas}{%
\section{The Australian Cancer Atlas}\label{the-australian-cancer-atlas}}

This thesis and it's contributions were motivated by the Australian Cancer Atlas (ACA), an online, interactive web tool for exploring the impact of cancer on Australian communities. The prominent display used by the ACA to present incidence rates or excess death rates is the choropleth map. The set of geographic units shown are the Australian Statistical Areas, at Level 2 (SA2s). There are almost 2,200 individual SA2s.

The choropleth map used in the ACA is familiar to the general public of Australia. It is appropriate to use this map display as users can orient themselves on the map and find the geographic areas relevant to them.
However, when the intention of the map user is to understand the whole spatial distribution, the information derived from the colours displayed on the map can be misleading.
The rural areas in outback Australia are over emphasised, and the densely populated inner city areas are not given enough attention, as they cannot be sen using a choropleth map.

\hypertarget{testing-graphical-displays}{%
\section{Testing graphical displays}\label{testing-graphical-displays}}

Visual inference testing will be used to determine if the communication of population geospatial statistics is more effective when using the new alternative hexagon tile map display.
Buja et al \autocite{GIIV} provide the `lineup' protocol as a formal framework for testing visual statistical methods. The new alternative visualisation method can be tested by implementing this framework.
It takes inspiration from a police lineup.
The lineup protocol can be used to test if the hexagon tile map is effective, a map displaying a real population based distribution can be hidden in a collection of maps that display null distributions \autocite{chowd}.

The `witness' in this regard is the participant recruited from a crowdsource platform.
The visualisation in the lineup that contains a real distribution is considered the `accused'.
It is put in a lineup of innocent displays that do not show a population based distribution.
If the `witness' chooses the `accused' when asked `Which display is the most different?' from the innocent plots, it can be considered that there may be a pattern displayed that is not present in the others.
In this protocol, the null hypothesis can be rejected in favour of the alternative when the `accused' display is chosen to be the most different display in the lineup. The null hypothesis fails to be rejected when it is not selected in the lineup.

This thesis aims to provide a solution to presenting geospatial data regarding populations.
It considers the visualisation methods developed over the past two centuries that shift the focus from the geographic map base.

\item
  \emph{Devising an Algorithm for creating hexagon tile maps of Australia:} The algorithm will take geospatial areas and create an alternative visualisation of the spatial distribution.
\item
  \emph{Test the effectiveness of the hexagon tile map relative to the choropleth map:} The hexagon tile map produced by the algorithm will be contrasted with the traditional choropleth map, applying the same colour methods to represent the data.
\item
  \emph{Communicating the relationship between the hexmap and choropleth map through animation:} Animations can maximise the benefits of both visualisation methods when communicating to the public. The use of animations may control how people follow a recognisable map of Australia into an alternative visualisation for inference.

\chapter{Cancer Applications of Choropleth Maps, and the Potential of Cartograms and Alternative Map Displays}\label{ch:literature}}

This literature review chapter provides an overview of the key areas of interest in the literature that are relevant to this thesis. This chapter is organised as follows. Section 1 outlines the traditional spatial mapping technique, the choropleth map, and provides design inspiration using examples of online cancer atlases. Section 2 outlines contemporary mapping approaches, suggested as alternatives to the choropleth. Section 3 compares and critiques these alternative displays in light of the strengths and weaknesses of the choropleth method. section 4 considers how users interact with mapping displays in online cancer atlases, and how map creators can direct the attention of uses through animation. Additionally, the following chapters in this thesis each begin with a section to introduce the specific relevant literature.

This chapter was submitted for publication to the journal \emph{Annals of Cancer Epidemiology} for publication. This was intended for an audience of cancer atlas creators to be inspired by current atlases, and to encourage the pursuit of alternative displays.

\section*{Abstract}\label{abstract-1}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abstract}

Cancer atlases communicate cancer statistics over geographic domains, typically with a choropleth map. They subdivide these domains into administrative regions such as countries, states, or suburbs. When communicating human-related statistics, the choropleth has a disadvantage in that it draws attention to sparsely populated rural areas to the neglect of small inner city areas. The smaller geographic areas are important to consider if they are densely populated. Alternative map displays, such as a cartogram or a hexagon tile map, can shift the attention of map users from the large rural areas by decreasing their size on the map display. This means alternative displays can be more effective at accurately communicating spatial patterns across spatial areas. It is recommended that alternative displays are included in cancer atlases. In addition, with the ease of today's technology, user interaction with the displays is encouraged. Users should also be able to interactively display different statistics, such as incidence rate or relative incidence, or filtered by demographic variables.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Researchers, health authorities, governments, not-for-profits and the media are common communicators of cancer statistics. They often present statistics to the public as aggregated values for geopolitical areas. Presenting these statistics requires aggregating individual observations for the geographical units, especially for privacy protection, but also for political and policy purposes. Examples of typical geographical units include states, provinces, local government areas, and post/zip codes. It is easy to provide counts or incidence rates of the diagnoses of these areas. This type of data is routinely collected for public health reasons and may be made available to the general public as a service to the community.

To visualize and communicate geospatial cancer statistics over geographic domain, a choropleth map is the common display. Choropleth maps show polygons representing the geographic units, where each polygon is shaded with a color according to the area-specific values of the statistic being conveyed. Visualizing this data is helpful as geographic patterns of disease may be obscured when reported in a table \autocite{SAMGIS}. Providing a visual representation of cancer outcomes allows identification of geographic patterns of the disease that can then be addressed with public health policy and actions. The spatial distribution of the disease incidence can be examined using a choropleth and may reveal a trend in longitude or latitude, or rural vs urban, or coastal vs inland, or even specific hot spots of the disease. One of the key challenges with mapping spatial patterns of disease is the design of visualizations \autocite{SE}. It is important to consider the strengths and weaknesses of designs, as visualizing diseases on maps is often the first step in exploratory spatial data analysis and helps in the formulation of hypotheses. This paper considers the current visualization techniques to communicate statistics to the public and their applications to cancer statistics. Alternative approaches are posed because they may be more effective than contemporary techniques. The limitations of the visualization methods, highlighting the differences and historic use of these displays is discussed.

The paper is structured as follows. The next section describes the choropleth map, which is the common approach to disease maps and presents examples of atlases in use today and discusses the limitations of the choropleth map. Section 3 describes alternative displays, including the cartogram, which is useful when the map has heterogeneously sized geographic units. Section 4 presents the limitations of the production and use of alternative displays. Disease maps are more useful when made interactive, and common options are described in Section 5, along with a discussion of benefits and disadvantages.

\hypertarget{ch:choropleth-maps}{%
\section{Traditional approaches for cancer map displays}\label{ch:choropleth-maps}}

A choropleth map displays the geographical distribution of data over a set of spatial units by shading areas of a map \autocite{EI}, \autocite{BCM}. Faithful rendering of the geography, when combined with an appropriate color scheme, can reveal spatial patterns among data values. Identifying and explaining spatial structures, patterns, and processes involve considering the individuals and organizing them into representable units of communities \autocite{SAMGIS}. Early versions of choropleth maps used symbols or patterns instead of color. Choropleth maps can be used for displaying disease data \autocite{DMAHP}, including cancer data \autocite{CPISACA}. In epidemiology, choropleth maps are often used as a tool to study the spatial distribution of cancer incidence and mortality.

Displaying familiar state boundaries can make a map easier to read \autocite{CIBMUK} and allow viewers to infer the spatial relationships visually in the data using their mental model of the geography. The map users of disease displays may include researchers, the public, policymakers, and the media \autocite{CPISACA}. For these users, the familiarity of the geography is a worthy consideration when presenting results of spatial analysis.

\hypertarget{ch:public}{%
\subsection{Cancer atlases}\label{ch:public}}

A cancer atlas is a map, or collection of maps, representing cancer incidence and mortality for a country, or group of countries. Atlases are key to developing hypotheses regarding areas with unusually high rates, and geographic correlations \autocite{MACM}. The data collection methods across regions and the administrative control within regions lends itself to choropleth visualization. Cancer maps and atlases date back to Haviland's maps in 1875, and early work in US cancer atlases appearing in 1971 \autocite{burbank}. The presentation of cancer statistics has increased with greater access to computational power and the availability of geographic information systems software \autocite{SE}.

Cancer maps are effective tools for communicating incidence, survival, and mortality to a wide range of audiences, including the public and others not trained in statistical analysis. These visualizations enable non-expert audiences to interpret the outputs of sophisticated statistical analysis. Cruickshank (1947) as cited by S. D. Walter \autocite{DMAHP}, discusses using visuals as a `formal statistical assessment of the spatial pattern'. Overwhelmingly, choropleth maps are visualisations chosen to communicate cancer statistics to members of the public and other non-expert audiences.

Epidemiologists and statisticians have developed the statistics used to communicate the burden of cancer over several decades. Table 2 summarizes the measures commonly presented in published cancer atlases. Mortality rates are commonly presented as relative rates of risk across the population and age-adjusted to correct for the higher prevalence of cancers in older populations. As described in Howe \autocite{HEDP}, Englishman P. Stocks advanced the field of mortality statistics by introducing the standardized mortality ratios in the 1930s, which is an improvement on crude death rates.

Roberts \autocite{roberts2019communication} identified 33 cancer atlases published between 2010 and 2018. Each of these online atlases uses choropleth maps. All except one of these were published by non-commercial organizations, including not-for-profits, government, research organizations, advocacy groups or government-funded partnerships. Figure 1 displays a subset of maps from these atlases, the selection varies in the geographies explored. Figure 1b shows Globocan 2018 \autocite{Globocan} which explores Estimated Cancer Incidence, Mortality and Prevalence Worldwide using data sourced from cancer registries of each country. The Bowel Cancer Australia Atlas in Figure 1d presents an example of a cancer specific atlas -- it shows the average Standardized Incidence Ratio of colorectal cancer for Australian males from 2006 to 2010 \autocite{Bowel}. Like many of the atlases examined, there is a choice of gender displayed in the Bowel Cancer Atlas. Gender is displayed in side-by-side maps in the Map of Cancer Mortality Rates in Spain (Figure 1f) \autocite{cancerSpain}.

Resolution of the maps varies greatly. Figure 1b shows global information at a national level. The United States Cancer Statistics \autocite{USInteractive} shows data aggregated at the state level. The Environment and Health Atlas of England and Wales \autocite{EnvEnglandWales2} (Figure 1a) shows the relative risk for women developing lung cancer at a neighborhood (small-area) scale. The Atlas of Cancer in Queensland (Figure 1c) shows the relative incidence ratio of lung cancer in males for each Statistical Area at Level 2 \autocite{abs2016} in the state of Queensland within Australia \autocite{QLDcancerAtlas}.

Age-specific atlases are less common. Figure 1g displays Atlas of Childhood Cancer in Ontario, this communicates the incidence rate of childhood cancers per 100,000 (by census division) for children aged 0-14, in Ontario from 1995 to 2004 \autocite{OntarioPediatric}.

\hypertarget{additional-considerations}{%
\subsection{Additional considerations}\label{additional-considerations}}

Cancer atlases often display supplementary graphs and plots to add more information. Additional materials such as tables, graphs, and text explanations support understanding and inference derived from maps, ensuring the message communicated will be consistent across a range of viewers \autocite{CPISACA}. The many displays of statistical summaries, including dot plots, bar plots, box plots, cumulative distribution plots, scatter plots, and normal probability plots, can provide alternative views of the cancer statistics. These can also display supporting statistics such as error, confidence intervals, distributions, sample or population sizes, and standard deviation.

The statistics communicated in atlases are often used to describe differences between areas. This can occur at different levels of aggregation. Aggregation of global health statistics occurs within administrative and arbitrarily defined regions, such as those used by the World Health Organization and the United Nations \autocite{IARC_3}. World atlases can allow for displays of data aggregated into continents, countries, states, provinces and congressional districts \autocite{USInteractive}. Each population area will probably have a different number of people, which is typically used to calibrate the statistic. Cancer atlases may also communicate the distribution of the population living in all areas in a table or histogram display \autocite{NICR_1}. Atlases can connect the population to the land available to them by communicating population density.

Maps can also be used to focus on demographic strata, such as age and sex. Some of the digital atlases surveyed allow subsets such as males, females, or those aged over 65, to be selected for display. Similarly, socioeconomic indicators, such as unemployment rates, poverty rates, remoteness, and education levels, can be used to filter data, in order to communicate how cancer prevalence varies for different members of society. Few atlases provide this level of detail.

Introducing population and demographic information helps to interpret the rates in areas effectively, but there will still be uncertainty around the rates. To address this, a cancer atlas often communicates uncertainty about the value of a statistic. There are several potential sources of uncertainty: sampling error, errors arising from the disease reporting process (or data collection), and errors arising from the statistical modelling or simulation process. The most common measures used to present uncertainty are credible or confidence intervals (CIs). Displaying the uncertainty associated with reported statistics is a vital feature of a cancer map, but it is difficult to display effectively. The map focuses on displaying the statistic and lacks additional space to represent the uncertainty. Providing an adjacent map or overlaying maps with symbols \autocite{VSSDCUC} are two common solutions.

\hypertarget{ch:chorolimit}{%
\subsection{Limitations of choropleth displays}\label{ch:chorolimit}}

Australia presents an extreme case of an urban rural divide. The land mass occupied by urban electoral districts is only 10\% of Australia, yet 90\% of the population live in these urban areas \autocite{ACTUC}.

Choropleth maps provide a familiar display, which shows data in a geographically recognisable way. A disadvantage is that the different population and geographical sizes of administrative areas can attract attention to the shades of the underpopulated but large areas \autocite{EI}. Skowronnek also \autocite{BCM} discusses how choropleth maps suffer from area-size bias, as they give a `stronger visual weight' to large administrative units. The administrative boundaries used to define regions may limit a choropleth display, as this display unfaithfully represents the disease distribution across the region by obscuring small geographic areas. Sparsely populated rural areas are emphasized, whereas the areas representing inner city communities are very small. This is especially true for Australia.

Choropleth maps colour each geographic unit to allow map users to measure the value of the statistic \autocite{EI}. Map users contrast the colours in neighbouring areas to understand the spatial distribution. The ColorBrewer system \autocite{CB} and viridis \autocite{viridis} palettes provide effective colour schemes for qualitative, sequential and diverging data. When communicating information using colour, a map creator should use a scheme that has a linear color gradient, with perceptually uniform color spaces that match equal steps in data space with equal steps in the colour space \autocite{PUCS}.
The use of borders and backgrounds, and their colours, can also change the appearance of the colors representing the value of the statistics \autocite{CB}. These supports can be used to implement a reference point in the colour scheme as well as orient users to the geographic regions.

Inset maps like in Brisbane city in Figure 1c of the state of Queensland are commonly used to reduce distorted interpretations, but it is a bandaid remedy. For Australia, many, many inset maps would be needed.

\hypertarget{ch:alternatives}{%
\section{Contemporary alternatives to choropleth maps}\label{ch:alternatives}}

\hypertarget{cartograms}{%
\subsection{Cartograms}\label{cartograms}}

Choropleth maps imply uniformity of data across the geographic space but population densities are unlikely to be uniform \autocite{BCM}. Cartographers developed the cartogram to draw the attention to the population by transforming the map \autocite{ACCAC}. The resulting display can communicate the impact of the disease more accurately across the population, as recorded by the statistic, at the sacrifice of geographic accuracy.

When a map creator desires a uniform population density of the map base, the purposeful distortion of the map space is beneficial. The ``population distribution is often extremely uneven'', making a distortion necessary so that population is more faithfully represented as a uniformly distributed background for the statistic to be presented \autocite{ACTUC} \autocite{CTTMB} \autocite{GOINO}. An area cartogram \autocite{NAC}, or population-by-area cartogram \autocite{TAAM} is produced from the distortion of the geographical shape according to population. Event cartograms \autocite{VSSDCUC} change the area of regions on a map depending on the amount of disease-related events, rather than population.

Cartograms provide an alternative visualization method for statistical and geographical information. Monmonier \autocite{HTLWM} suggests that map creators can use white lies to create useful spatial displays. It is easy for the reader to disregard the impact of transformations used to create cartograms, for the benefit of reading the statistical distribution more accurately with approximate geographic information. The spatial transformation of map regions relative to the data emphasizes the data distribution instead of land size \autocite{CBATCC}. When visualizing population statistics, Dorling considers this design `more socially just' \autocite{ACTUC}, or honest \autocite{NISCC}, giving equitable representation and attention to all members of the population and reducing the visual impact of large areas with small populations \autocite{DMAHP}. Howe \autocite{HEDP} suggests that `cancer occurs in people, not in geographical areas' and that spatial socio-economic data, like cancer rates, are best presented on a cartogram for urban areas as the population map base avoids allocating `undue prominence' to rural areas \autocite{CTTMB}.

The creation of cartograms was historically in the hands of professional cartographers \autocite{CD}. Early approaches by John Hunter and Jonathan Young (1968) and Durham's wooden tile method, Skoda and Robertson's (1972) steel ball-bearing approach and Tobler's (1973) computer programs \autocite{ACTUC}. Howe \autocite{HEDP} discusses the impact of electronic computer-assisted techniques. Geographical information systems allow map creators to produce cartograms and they use these systems depending on `the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the map products' \autocite{CD}.

There are two key issues to consider when creating alternative map displays, (1) the intended audience of the map, and (2) its purpose. Nusrat and Kobourov \autocite{SAIC} provided a framework to investigate implementations of the many algorithms presented, and the ``statistical accuracy, geographical accuracy, and topological accuracy''.

Figure 2 shows four different cartograms for the same data. The information in Table 3 summarizes what can be observed in the four types of cartograms.

\hypertarget{contiguous}{%
\subsubsection{Contiguous}\label{contiguous}}

A contiguous cartogram alters the choropleth according to a statistic and maintains connectivity of the map regions. Min Ouyang and Revesz \autocite{ACA} present three algorithms for creating value-by-area cartograms. They implement `map deformation' to account for the value assigned to each area. Other methods include Tobler's Pseudo-Cartogram Method, Dorling's Cellular Automaton Method \autocite{ACTUC}, Radial Expansion Method, Rubber Sheet Method, Line Integral Method, Constraint-Based Method \autocite{CBATCC}.

Figure 2a shows a population contiguous cartogram of the United States. All states are visible and the shape of the United States overall is still recognizable. In contrast, Figure 3 a shows an Australian contiguous cartogram also based on population. The south east is enlarged, but high population areas are still small, and low population areas are still large on the map. The algorithm doesn't fully reach an optimal configuration where area matches population -- Australia is too heterogeneous for the algorithm to handle.

To be able to recognize the significant changes, a reader will usually have to know the initial geography to find the differences in the new cartogram layout \autocite{NAC}. The shapes of small areas on a choropleth map and a cartogram are preserved using Tobler's Conformal mapping method.
Koccmoud and House \autocite{CBATCC} present this issue as conflicting tasks or aims, to adjust region sizes and retain region shapes.

\hypertarget{non-contiguous}{%
\subsubsection{Non-contiguous}\label{non-contiguous}}

Non-contiguous cartograms prioritize the shapes of the areas instead of connectivity. Each area stays in a similar position to its location on a choropleth map. Displaying the choropleth map base allows map users to make comparisons regarding the change in the area. The addition is the gap between areas, created as each area shrinks or grows according to the associated value of the statistic. Olson \autocite{NAC} discusses the creation of these maps and the significance of the empty areas left between the geographic boundaries and the new shape.

The white space presents the meaningful empty-space property \autocite{ECGC}, \autocite{NAC} but it also distracts the reader from the data, with a low data density \autocite{TVDQI}.

\hypertarget{dorling}{%
\subsubsection{Dorling}\label{dorling}}

Daniel Dorling presents an alternative display engineered to highlight the spatial distribution and neighborhood relationships without complex distortions of borders and boundaries \autocite{ACTUC}:

\begin{quote}
``If, for instance, it is desirable that areas on a map have boundaries which are as simple as possible, why not draw the areas as simple shapes in the first place?''
\end{quote}

He acknowledged the sophistication of contiguous cartograms but critiqued their `very complex shapes,' he answers this with his implementation of maps created using `the simplest of all shapes'. Circular cartograms use the same circle shape for every region represented, resized according to the statistic represented or the population. This simple shape may be more effective for understanding the spatial distribution than contiguous cartograms. Contiguous cartograms create `nonsense' shapes that have `no meaning' \autocite{NISCC}. Both methods applies a gravity model to produce a layout, that avoids overlaps and keep spatial relationships with neighboring areas over many iterations. The circular cartogram is relatively fast to compute.

Raisz \autocite{RSCW} laid the groundwork for this approach in the mid-1930s, drawing rectangular cartograms that provide simple comparisons, effective for correcting misconceptions communicated by geographic maps. Tobler \autocite{TFYCC} names and defines these as Value-Area Cartograms. This rectangular display may sacrifice contiguity but allows for tiling where geographic neighbors placed in suitable relative positions also share borders \autocite{CDWCS}. Rectangular cartograms communicate bivariate displays of the population by the size of each rectangular, and they use color to communicate a second variable \autocite{ORC}.

\hypertarget{tile-map}{%
\subsection{Tile Map}\label{tile-map}}

A tile map provides a tessellated display of consistent shapes. A similar method to a rectangular cartogram, represents each geographic area using a square. The squares are tessellated to create a grid. Each area is represented by a square of the same dimensions, each tile is usually one unit of measurement, this could be geographic regions such as states or population-based that use a consistent measure of population for each tile. Regions with over four neighbors require some necessary displacement. The tile map uses color to represent a value of a statistic for each area. A similar method to a rectangular cartogram represents each geographic area using a square of the same dimensions. There are online media sources using this method, these include \autocite{NPR}, \autocite{FiveThirtyEight}, \autocite{WSJ}, \autocite{WP}. Tile maps may be difficult to create as they are best created manually, they require additional time and care as the number of geographic areas to include increases.

Cano and others \autocite{MDAC} define the term `mosaic cartograms' for hexagonal tile displays, where the number of tiles for each area or the color of them can communicate the statistic of regions. When using several tiles per region, map makers can adjust the complexity of the boundaries in the resulting display. They can also make a trade-off between boundary complexity and simplicity by the size of the tiles used.

\hypertarget{geofacet}{%
\subsection{Geofacet}\label{geofacet}}

Hafen \autocite{IGF} introduces the term geofacet to describe a grid display of small plots. The arrangement of tiles mimics the geographic topology. Geofaceting has the functionality that a statistical plot can be constructed in each facet for each geographic area. A tile map can communicate only one value per region in a visualization, while geofaceting is a more flexible visualization for communication as it increases the amount of information displayed. Virtually any type of plot can be shown in the tile, allowing displays of multiple variables or values per geographic entity. Creating the layout of a geofacet is manual, but once created can be used for any data on that geographic base.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{multivariate-displays}{%
\subsection{Multivariate displays}\label{multivariate-displays}}

Pickle and others \autocite{MMST} present linked micromap plots to match geographic and statistical data visually, this serves as a solution to multi-dimensionality issues. These maps group areas based on their value for one variable, and additional columns provide displays that contrast the areas in each group by other variables. The display juxtaposes choropleth maps and statistical plots; it shows one map per group of the key separating variable, in a row with each additional statistical plot. Linked micromaps predominantly use the choropleth map for displays of spatial relationships. These maps show spatial relationships by allotting spatial neighbors to the same group. It is one of several alternative displays that allow maps to become bivariate displays, commonly used to present both an estimate and the associated uncertainty.

Lucchesi and Wikle \autocite{VUADBC} present bivariate choropleth maps blend color schemes to convey the intersection of categorized levels of an estimate and the associated uncertainty for each spatial area. They also suggest map pixilation, which breaks each region into small pixels, and allocates values to the individual pixels to create texture. This reflects the uncertainty around the area's estimate by randomly sampling from the confidence interval of the estimate of the area. Animating these displays involves resampling the pixels for each frame. Areas with uncertain values will flicker more dramatically than areas with more certain values.

Figure 4 shows four main types of cartograms using melanoma incidence on Australian Statistical Areas at Level 3 \autocite{abs2016}. The version of a contiguous cartogram (a) has expanded the highly populated areas while preserving the full shapes of rural areas. It has not fully resolved the population transformation of areas, and if it had accurately sized areas by population, the country would be unrecognizable. The shape-preserved cartogram is unreadable, and it has reduced all areas to tiny spots on the map. Zooming in on a high-resolution output shows it does preserve the shapes. The Dorling cartogram and the hexagon tile map provide reasonable displays of the spatial distribution, despite having too much white-space in the outback areas.

\hypertarget{limitations-of-alternative-displays}{%
\subsection{Limitations of alternative displays}\label{limitations-of-alternative-displays}}

Cartograms provide the spatial distortion to more accurately convey the statistical distribution, focusing on the human impact of the disease. However, the transformation of contiguous cartograms often occurs at the expense of the shape of areas \autocite{CBATCC}, {[}\textcite{NAC}, \autocite{TAAM}. When the population density of the geographic units is highly dissonant with geographic density, the cartogram will lose all spatial context. Dorling \autocite{ACTUC} has a cartogram showing the 1966 general election results, which looked very little like the geographical shape of Australia.

Some mix of tiling, faceting or even micromaps, which allow some spatial continuity while also zooming into small areas, are good solutions for difficult geographies. Table 3 summarizes the key criteria for testing maps and alternative displays. Moore and Carpenter \autocite{SAMGIS} and Bell et al.~\autocite{CPISACA} provide suggestions and comments to help map creators best communicate their health data and spatial analysis.

\hypertarget{ch:interacting}{%
\section{User interaction}\label{ch:interacting}}

One of the concerns of adding too much information to a map is the fear of cognitive overload \autocite{mcgranaghan1993cartographic} in which the user reaches an information threshold, beyond which they become confused. It can be a juggling act for a diverse audience, with experts probably preferring more detail \autocite{cliburn2002design} while a simpler display is more broadly readable. Interactivity is a design feature within modern mapping methods that can be used to incorporate additional information and complexity without overloading the user. Effective user-centred interactive actions produce rapid, incremental, and reversible changes to the display \autocite{DMIV}.

Monmonier \autocite{HTLWM} says that interactivity can be used to allow users to explore the map for more information and provides flexibility for the display. The user can toggle between different variables, map views or even multiple realizations of future scenarios \autocite{goodchild1994introduction}. This provides additional mechanisms for the users to digest the uncertainty of the available information \autocite{maceachren1992visualizing}, \autocite{van1994visualization}. When the needs of the audience are changeable and are also the priority, the map creator can allow interactivity for map users to explore a data set through dynamic interactions. This can allow inspection of the data from many views \autocite{DQBCM}. User interaction with maps helps to understand and interpret the spatial distribution of disease, to validate, explain or explore the presented statistics and their relationships to each other \autocite{TNTEA}.

Interactivity enables supplementary information to be incorporated into online atlases without cluttering the display. Interactive design features, found in online cancer maps, include tool tips, drop-down menus, data selection, zooming, and panning to allow users to explore the map as they want more information and allow flexibility in the display \autocite{HTLWM}. The use of these supports can be found in various online cancer maps and are shown in Figure 5 \autocite{roberts2019communication}.

Animation, in contrast to interactivity, usually involves pre-computing views and showing these in a sequence. Lin Pedersen \autocite{TGA} provides an overview of animation for maps using the R package \texttt{gganimate} \autocite{gganimate}. Animations are used to communicate a message by capturing and directing users' attention. It is most often employed to show changes over time. The controls for basic animation are usually placed outside of the plot space \autocite{TGA}, and the map image is updated/replaced as the animation progresses.

Weather maps are a thoroughly developed examples of animation of spatial displays to communicate information to the general public \autocite{CPISACA}. The movement of a weather system will follow a forecasted path. All map users can follow the animated path of the weather system across the geography over a specified period.

The Australian Cancer Atlas \autocite{TACA} provides \href{https://atlas.cancer.org.au/app/tour/lungcancer}{tours} that change the display to draw users' attention to areas on the map that are relevant to the story.
This implementation of animation gives users tools to plan their exploration.

Figure 6 shows two examples of more sophisticated interactive maps. The Spanish Cancer map (left) contains a linked display between a choropleth map and time series plots of cancer change. In linked plots, changing values in one display will trigger changes of corresponding elements in another display. Here, the temporal change in the choropleth map can be played out as an animation. Mousing over the time series plots will highlight the line for a particular region. The Canadian Breast Cancer Mortality map (right) has a magnifying glass that allows the user to zoom into small areas. It is easy to control and shows precise details in small areas.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

This paper provides an overview of mapping practices as commonly used for cancer atlases and recommends new approaches, such as cartograms and hexagon tile maps that should be adopted going forward. The conventional approach is the choropleth map, and it is widely used. The choropleth map suffers when there are small geographic units, as occurs in Australia where the population is concentrated on the coast, the information about the burden of cancer on those communities can be hidden. Making an inset can clarify congested regions but this breaks the viewers' attention as they shift focus from the map to the inset, and if there are many congested areas, many insets would be needed. The map alternatives implement trade-offs between the familiar shapes, and the importance of the geographic areas in the context of the areas. Given the population or a cancer statistic for each area, the geographic size or shape will change. Alternative displays allow the spatial distribution of cancer data to be digested by map users.

Many statistics are commonly used in cancer displays. The most basic is the incidence rate. It is common to see relative rates which measure how far a region is above or below the average. The purpose of using a relative rate is, perhaps the desire to pinpoint the areas that need attention because they have higher than expected rates.
A region might be much higher than average, but it may not be close to a health concern, because all regions have a low incidence. Supplementary materials can allow map users to recognise when this occurs.

Interaction with maps is an important component of public atlases, and is easy to add with today's technology. The purpose is to provide access to more information than is possible to display in a single map, without overwhelming the viewer. Too many choices can similarly overwhelm a viewer, and thus decisions do need to be made about content to provide for accurate and comprehensive communication of information. Similarly, providing ways for users to interact with the display encourages engagement, and creative, efficient, elegant, interactive tools elicit curiosity about the data.

This chapter relates to the first research aim as stated in Section \ref{sec:aims}.
The chapter introduces the step devised for the algorithm.
The chapter frames the steps in light of the \texttt{sugarbag} \autocite{sugarbag} package functions that allow users to enact the algorithm in \texttt{R} \autocite{R}. It uses the Statisical Areas of Australia at Level 2, taking a subset and considering only those located within the island of Tasmania.
It also provides an example of how to animate between the choropleth map display and the hexagon tile map.

This chapter was submitted for publication to the \emph{Journal of Statistical Software} for publication.

This algorithm creates a tesselated hexagon display to represent each of the spatial polygons. It allocates these hexagon in a manner that preserves the spatial relationship of the geographic units. It showcases spatial distributions, by emphasising the small geographical regions that are often difficult to locate on geographic maps. Spatial distributions have been presented on alternative representations of geography for many years. In modern times, interactivity and animation have begun to play a larger role, as alternative representations have been popularised by online news sites, and atlas websites with a focus on public consumption. Applications are increasingly widespread, especially in the areas of disease mapping, and election results.

\hypertarget{introduction-1}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}}

The current practice for presenting geospatial data is a choropleth map display. These maps highlight the geographic patterns in geospatially related statistics \autocite{SAMGIS}.
The land on the map space is divided into geographic units, these boundaries are usually administrative, such as states or counties. The units are filled with colour to represent the value of the statistic \autocite{EI}.

Australian residents are increasingly congregating around major cities, the vast rural areas are often sparsely populated in comparison to the urban centres.
In Australia, government bodies such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), and the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) hold the responsibility for the division of the population into geographic units. If it necessary, the AEC may adjust the boundaries of the areas as the population increases. The division of the population into approximately equal population areas results in dramatically different square meterage of the geographic areas. This can give unequal attention to the statistic of each area, this can cause misrepresentation of the spatial distributions of human related statistics in geographic maps.

The solutions to this visualisation problem begin with the geography. Cartograms apply a transformation to the geographic boundaries based on the value of the statistic of interest. These displays result in a distortion of the map space to represent differences in the statistic across the areas \autocite{ACCAC}.
The statistic of interest is used to determine the cartogram layout. When the
Australian population is the statistic of interest, the result is a population cartogram. They fail to preserve a recognisable display due to the difference in size of metropolitan and rural areas \autocite{ACTUC}, \autocite{GOINO}.
Contiguous cartograms change the shape of areas, while preserving boundary relationships of neighbours. Non-contiguous cartograms maintain the geographic shape of each geographic area, but will lose the connection to neighbours as the polygon for each geographic area shrinks or grows.

Alternative maps shift the focus from land area and shape, to the value of the statistics in a group of areas.
Alternative mapping methods allow increased understanding of the spatial distribution of a variable across the population, by fairly representing each administrative area. This acknowledges that the amount of residents can be different but recognises that each area, or person within it is equally important.

tile maps, Rectangular cartograms \autocite{ORC} and Dorling cartograms \autocite{ACTUC}, all use one simple shape to represent each area. They place various importance on the preservation of spatial relationships, but all decrease the emphasis on the size of the geographic areas. These alternative map displays focus on the relationship between neighbours, attempting to preserve connections, and disregard the unique shapes of the administrative boundaries.

The \texttt{sugarbag} package provides a new algorithm to create tesselated hexagon tile maps.
It emphasises the capital cities as population hubs, and emphasises the distances rather than size of large, rural geographic units.

\hypertarget{algorithm}{%
\section{Algorithm}\label{algorithm}}

The algorithm presented in \texttt{sugarbag} package operates on a set of simple feature geometry objects, also known as \texttt{sf} \autocite{sf} polygons.

There are four steps performed to create a tesselated hexagon tile map.
These steps can be executed by the main function, \texttt{create\_hexmap}, or can be implemented separately for more flexibility. There are parameters used in the process that can be provided by users, if they are not, they will be automatically derived.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Create the set of centroids to allocate
\item
  Create the grid of hexagons locations to use
\item
  Allocate each centroid to an available hexagon
\item
  Transform the data for plotting
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{parameters}{%
\subsubsection{Parameters}\label{parameters}}

The \texttt{create\_hexmap} function requires several parameters, if they are not provided, the information will be derived from the simple features (\texttt{sf}) set of shapes used. Users may choose to only use the \texttt{allocate} function when they wish to use a set of centroids, rather than \autocite{sf} polygons.

The following parameters must be provided to `create\_hexmap\}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{shp:} an sf object containing the polygon information
\item
  \emph{sf\_id:} name of a column that distinguishes unique areas
\item
  \emph{focal\_points:} a data frame of reference locations used to allocate hexagons
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{polygon-set}{%
\subsubsection{Polygon set}\label{polygon-set}}

The polygon set of Statistical Areas at Level 2 (SA2) \autocite{abs2016} of Tasmania in 2016 is provided with the \texttt{sugarbag} package as \texttt{tas\_sa2}.
A single column of the data set is used to identify the unique areas.
In this case, the unique SA2 names for each SA2 have been used.

The longitude and latitude centre of the capital cities of Australia are used as focal points to allocate each geographic area around the closest capital city. Hobart will be the common focal point, as this example uses only the areas in the state of Tasmania.

\KeywordTok{data}\NormalTok{(capital_cities)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The following parameters will be determined within \texttt{create\_hexmap} if they are not provided. They are created as they are needed throughout the following example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{buffer\_dist:} a float value for distance in degrees to extend beyond the geometry provided
\item
  \emph{hex\_size:} a float value in degrees for the diameter of the hexagons
\item
  \emph{hex\_filter:} amount of hexagons around centroid to consider for allocation
\item
  \emph{width:} the angle used to filter the grid points around a centroid
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{create-the-set-of-centroid-points}{%
\subsubsection{Create the set of centroid points}\label{create-the-set-of-centroid-points}}

A set of centroids may be used directly. The set of polygons should be provided as an \texttt{sf} object, this is a data frame containing a \texttt{geometry} column. The \texttt{read\_shape} function can assist in creating this object for use in \texttt{R}.

The centroids can be derived from the set of polygons using the \texttt{create\_centroids} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{centroids <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{create_centroids}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{shp_sf =}\NormalTok{ tas_sa2, }\DataTypeTok{sf_id =} \StringTok{"SA2_NAME16"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{create-the-hexagon-grid-points}{%
\subsubsection{Create the hexagon grid points}\label{create-the-hexagon-grid-points}}

A grid is created to ensure tessellation between the hexagons that represent the geographic units on a hexagon tile map.

The grid of possible hexagon locations is made using the \texttt{create\_grid} function.
It uses the centroids, the hexagon size and the buffer distance.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{grid <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{create_grid}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{centroids =}\NormalTok{ centroids, }\DataTypeTok{hex_size =} \FloatTok{0.2}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{buffer_dist =} \FloatTok{1.2}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{step-1-creating-a-tesselated-grid}{%
\subparagraph{Step 1: Creating a tesselated grid}\label{step-1-creating-a-tesselated-grid}}

A set of longitude columns, and latitude rows are created to define the locations of the hexagons. The distance between each row and column is the size specified by \texttt{hex\_size}.
Equally spaced columns are created from the minimum longitude minus the buffer distance, up to the maximum longitude plus the buffer distance. Similarly, the rows are created from the latitude values and the buffer distance.
A unique hexagon location is created from all intersections of the longitude columns and latitude rows.
Figure \ref{fig:grid2} shows the original grid on the left, to allow for tessellating hexagons, every second latitude row on the grid is shifted right, by half of the hexagon size. The grid for tessellation is shown on the right.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=16cm]{figures/03-algorithm/2grid.png}
\caption{\label{fig:grid2}Grid points to create a tile map.}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{step-2-rolling-windows}{%
\subparagraph{Step 2: Rolling windows}\label{step-2-rolling-windows}}

Not all of the grid points will be used, especially if islands result in a large grid space.
To filter the grid for appropriate hexagon locations for allocation, the \texttt{create\_buffer} function is used by \texttt{create\_grid}.
It finds the grid points needed to best capture the set of centroids on a hexagon tile map.

The closest latitude row and longitude column are found for each centroid location. Then rows and columns of centroids are divided into 20 groups.
The amount of rows in each latitude group and the amount of columns in each longitude group are used as the width of rolling windows. The rolling windows can be seen on the bottom and right of the gris shown in Fig. \ref{fig:filter-grid}.
This will tailor the available grid points to those most likely to be used.
It also helps reduce the amount of time taken, as it decreases the amount of points considered for each centroid allocation.

The first rolling window function finds the minimum and maximum centroid values for the sliding window groups of longitude columns and the groups of latitude rows.

The second rolling window function finds the average of the rolling minimum and maximum centroid values, for the longitude columns and latitude rows.

\hypertarget{step-3-filtering-the-grid}{%
\subparagraph{Step 3: Filtering the grid}\label{step-3-filtering-the-grid}}

The grid points are kept only if they fall between the rolling average of the minimum and maximum centroid values after accounting for the buffer distance, for each row and column of the grid. The sparsely populated South-West region of National Park has much fewer points available compared to the South-East region containing the city of Hobart.

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=16cm]{figures/03-algorithm/3grid.png}
\caption{\label{fig:filter-grid}All possible hexagon locations from the initial grid are shown with blue outlines. The blue dots show the grid points left to choose from after the buffer step. The rolling windows show the collections of rows and columns used to filter the hexagon locations.}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{centroid-to-focal-point-distance}{%
\subsubsection{Centroid to focal point distance}\label{centroid-to-focal-point-distance}}

The distance between each centroid in the set, and each of the focal points provided is calculated. The name of the closest focal point, and the distance and angle from focal point to polygon centroid is joined to polygon data set. To minimise time taken for this step only one option is provided, Tasmania's capital city Hobart.
The order for allocation is determined by the distance between the polygon centroid and it's closest focal point. The points are arranged from the centroid closest to the focal point(s), to the furthest.

\hypertarget{allocate-each-centroid-to-a-hexagon-grid-point}{%
\subsubsection{Allocate each centroid to a hexagon grid point}\label{allocate-each-centroid-to-a-hexagon-grid-point}}

Allocation of all centroids takes place using the set of polygon centroids and the hexagon map grid.
Centroid allocation begins with the closest centroid to a focal point.
This will preserve spatial relationships with the focal point, as the inner city areas are allocated first, they will be placed closest to the capital, and the areas that are further will then be accommodated.
The possible hexagon grid points reduces by one after each allocation, then only those that have not yet been allocated are considered.

The possible hexagon locations to consider for a centroid are determined by the \texttt{hex\_filter}. This is the maximum amount of hexagons between the centroid and the furthest considered hexagon. It is used to subset possible grid points to only those surrounding the polygon centroid within an appropriate range. A smaller distance will increase speed, but can decrease accuracy when width of the angle increases.

The following example considers the first of the Statistical Areas at Level 2.
Within the algorithm, these steps are repeated for each polygon.

\hypertarget{step-1-filter-the-grid-for-unassigned-hexagon-points}{%
\subparagraph{Step 1: Filter the grid for unassigned hexagon points}\label{step-1-filter-the-grid-for-unassigned-hexagon-points}}

Keeping only the available hexagon points prevents multiple geographic units from being allocated to the same hexagon.

\hypertarget{step-2-filter-the-grid-points-for-those-closest-to-the-centroid}{%
\subparagraph{Step 2: Filter the grid points for those closest to the centroid}\label{step-2-filter-the-grid-points-for-those-closest-to-the-centroid}}

A box of possible hexagon locations around the centroid allows only the closest points that are not yet assigned to be considered. The corners of the box may not appear square if the buffer step has already removed unnecessary points from over the ocean.

The algorithm then removes the outer corners of the square, creating a circle of points, by only keeping points within a certain radial distance around the original centroid location.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=16cm]{figures/03-algorithm/4grid.png}
\caption{\label{fig:buffers}Filter for grid points within a square, then circular, distance for those closest to the centroid.}
\end{figure}

The \texttt{width} parameter is used to take a slice of the remaining points. The width is the amount of degrees used on either side of the angle from the focal point to centroid location. This uses the angle from the closest capital city, to the current centroid as seen in Figure \ref{fig:angles} . This allows the spatial relationship to be preserved, even when it is allocated to a hexagon that is further from the focal point then the original centroid location.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=16cm]{figures/03-algorithm/5allocate.png}
\caption{\label{fig:angles}Filter for grid points within the angle from the focal point to the centroid.}
\end{figure}

If no available hexagon grid point is found within the original filter distance and angle, the distance is expanded, only when a maximum distance is reached will the angle expand to accommodate more possible grid points.\\
By default the angle filter to hexagon grid points that fall within the bounds of the angle from the focal point to the geographic centroid, plus and minus 30 degrees. This will increase if no points can be found within the \texttt{hex\_filter} distance. The default angle of 30 was chosen to allow the algorithm to choose hexagons that best maintained the spatial relationship between the focal point and geographic centroid.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=16cm]{figures/03-algorithm/6allocate.png}
\caption{\label{fig:buffs}A complete hexagon tile map of Tasmania.}
\end{figure}

A complete hexagon tile map of Tasmania is created by applying the algorithm steps to each centroid.
The hexagon tile map visualisation is used below to visualise the Australian Cancer Atlas data. Two views of the same data are produced by filling according to the Lung Cancer Standardised Incidence Rates (SIRs) downloaded from the Australian Cancer Atlas site. This small example in Figure \ref{fig:sir} shows the group of blue areas in the Hobart CBD more prominently in the hexagon tile map (b).
The small red areas visible in the choropleth map (a) along the north coast are much larger in the hexagon tile maps. The hexagon tile map shows less yellow, this no longer overwhelms the map space with the information regarding the rural areas.

\end{figure}

\hypertarget{neighbour-relationships}{%
\subsubsection{Neighbour relationships}\label{neighbour-relationships}}

It is possible to consider the neighbouring areas for each SA2, for stronger preservation of the spatial distribution.

An additional step can be included to allow the neighbours that have alredy been allocated to influence the placement of the current centroid.
This requires specifying the \texttt{sf} object as the argument for the \texttt{use\_neighbours} parameter. This calculates neighbours using intersections of their polygons. This occurs for all areas before any allocations begin.

During the allocation of each centroid, the list of neighbours is consulted. If any neighbour was already allocated, the hexagons surrounding the neighbours on the grid are prioritised. For multiple neighbours, the neighbouring hexagon grid points are aggregated and considered in order of distance from the original centroid.

\subsubsection{Australian Cancer Atlas}\label{australian-cancer-atlas}}

The Australian Cancer Atlas \autocite{TACA} allows estimates derived from the models of Standardised Incidence Rates and excess deaths to be downloaded.
Figure \ref{fig:melanoma-geo} is a choropleth map that uses colour to display the estimated Standardised Incidence Rate of melanoma cancer for all persons for each SA2. The Australian choropleth map display draws attention to the expanse of light blue areas across the rural communities in all states. The SA2s around Brisbane stand out as more orange and red.
Comparatively, the hexagon tile map display in Figure \ref{fig:melanoma-hex} draws attention to contrast of the blue areas in Sydney and Melbourne and the capital city of Brisbane. In both Sydney and Melbourne, the hexagons that represent the SA2 areas in the inner-city areas have lower than average Incidence Rates.

With careful consideration of the choropleth map, the small geographic inner city areas may have been noticed by viewers, but the hexagon tile map display emphasises them. The communities in northern Queensland and the Northern territory do not draw attention because of their size as in the choropleth, but their colour is still noticably below average when contrasted with the heaxgons further south.

To create this choropleth map the SA2 polygons for 2011 from the ABS. The Standardised Incidence Ratios for each geographic unit are joined to the appropriate polygons.

\section{Animation}\label{animation}}

The \texttt{gganimate} \autocite{gganimate} package can be used to make an animation.
It requires connecting the polygons for each area in two displays, which can be done using the \texttt{sf\_id} variable, such as the SA2 name.
The animation\footnote{This animation can be viewed at: \url{https://sugarbagjss.netlify.com/}} connecting these two displays will highlight the rapid growth of the inner-city areas, and will decrease the large rural areas. The hexagons that move the furthest will move rapidly in the animation.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

It is possible to use alternative maps to communicate spatial distributions.While a choropleth map display is the current practice spatial visualisation of geographical data. Current methods do not always work for Australia due to the large geographic space between the densely populated capital cities. The administrative boundaries may also distract from the statistics communicated using colour.

Alternative maps highlight the value of the statistics across the geographic units. Alternative mapping methods allow increased understanding of the spatial distribution of a variable across the population, by fairly representing each administrative area. This acknowledges that the amount of residents can be different but recognises that each population area is equally important. The solution to this visualisation problem has equally sized areas, with neighbourhood boundary connections. This map algorithm is implemented in the \texttt{sugarbag} \autocite{sugarbag} package written for \texttt{R} \autocite{R}.
The \texttt{sugarbag} package creates tesselated hexagon tile maps. The Australian application preserves the spatial relationships, emphasising capital cities. The hexagon tile map is a visualisation solution that highlights spatial distributions.

These hexagons equally represent each area. However, the tesselation does not allow the size of the hexagons to represent another variable, similar to the choropleth maps.
The algorithm is heavily dependent on the focal points used, as this determines the order of allocation. It works on the assumption that viewers can use directional relationships to identify their neighbourhoods but this can be aided by the animation.

Future work will include refining the algorithm. It would be possible to take a logarithmic function rather than a direct angle to help choose a closer hexagon to the original centroid location, before increasing the width of the angle used to filter the hexagons.

This algorithm has only been tested using single countries, and does not consider definite borders of countries. While the buffer allows extention beyond the furthest centroids, there is no mechanism to protect the borders and ensure centroids are placed within the geographic borders of a country.

This algorithm is an effective start to creating hexagon tile maps for many geographic units.

\chapter{Comparing the Effectiveness of the Choropleth Map with a Hexagon Tile Map for Communicating Cancer Manuscript submitted for publication}\label{ch:experiment}}

This chapter tests the performance of the hexagon tile map display created using the algorithm discussed in Section \ref{ch:algorithm}.
It outlines the lineup protocol method of visual inference that can be used to test the effectiveness of information visualisations.
Using a two factor experimental design, the experiment contrasts the performance of participants when they viewed a choropleth map, and their performance when viewing a hexagon tile map.
The experiment also considered three types of spatial trends, one geographic trend, and two population related distributions.
The results showed that participants did in fact more frequently find the population related distributions when using the hexagon tile map.

This chapter has been submitted to the journal \emph{IEEE Transactions of Visualisation and Computer Graphics}.

\chapter{Discussion and Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}}

Cancer Atlases are used to develop hypotheses about spatial distributions of cancer statistics \autocite{CPISACA}. However, the use of the choropleth map may lead to misinterpretation of the overall distribution. This is because of the overemphasis on the large geographic areas, and the lack of visibility for the small inner-city communities \autocite{ACTUC}.

The first aim of this thesis was to present an alternative visualisation method for spatial data. This thesis has provided a new algorithm to present spatial distributions of disease data, and includes an R code \autocite{R} implementation. The spatial data sets with population related distributions will be effectively communicated by this display. The hexagon tile map display will represent each area equally on the map space to effectively convey the spatial distribution. This does not require manual creation of layouts, and the displays are reusable for any data set that uses the same set of geographic units.

The second aim was to test effectiveness of the hexagon tile map relative to the choropleth map. It was expected that the familiar map base would have advantages in communicating geospatial distributions. However, when tested using the lineup protocol the results for the choropleth map and hexagon tile map were extrememly close. The hexagon tile map was much more effective for communicating the population related distributions.

To achieve the third aim of this thesis, the hexagon tile map output allows for animation between the choropleth display and the hexagon tile map display. This was acheived through the implementation of the \texttt{sugarbag} \autocite{sugarbag} package for R \autocite{R}.

The hexagon tile map visualisation method solves the misrepresentation problem of choropleth display. Especially for geographic data sets that contain a substantial amounts of areas. This algorithm is accessible to all \texttt{R} users, it can be applied to any set of areas in an \texttt{sf} \autocite{sf} object through the set of simple functions.
The tessellation employed in the hexagon tile map algorithm maintains connectedness between neighbouring areas, this draws inspiration from contiguous cartograms \autocite{ACA}, rectangular cartograms \autocite{RSCW} and Dorling's circular cartograms \autocite{ACTUC}. However, the hexagon tile map algorithm does not employ the gravitation pull mathematics that is used to create contiguous cartograms. It also does not iterate on the placement of hexagons. The choice of a consistent shape to be used for all areas draws from rectangular and Dorling cartograms. This encourages map readers to focus on the similarities or difference in the colour between geographic neighbours, and does not distract them with unfamiliar boundaries produced during a contiguous cartogram transformation.

The effectiveness of the hexagon tile map has been proved by the visual inference study. It showed that participants could recognise the data display in the set of null distributions more frequently when viewing a hexagon tile map display. The choropleth map display is still effective for distributions that are directly related to the geography, such as the North-West to South-East distribution used in the study. This has expanded the applications of visual inference studies in a spatial data context by contributing a specific example of testing new graphical displays for geospatial data.

The tile map allocation provided by the algorithm can easily be used to create animations between a choropleth and hexagon tile map display. Linking the familiar geography to the effective display for understanding the distribution across many heterogeneous geographic regions. Many interactive tools are included in current cancer atlases, these additions allow user driven exploration, but do not guarantee that the spatial distribution across the geographic space is digested accurately.
Animating between a choropleth and a hexagon tile map will allows map users to understand how the small communities of a whole country are affected simultaneously. It also teaches map users how to find areas of interest as their attention is drawn to the capital cities, that may not have caught their attention in the display of the choropleth map. When communicating cancer statistics, there should be a balance between providing people a familiar landscape and ensuring the interpret the spatial distribution correctly. Animations will communicate a specific message through the capture and direction of users' attention.

Future work will include expanding on the criteria used to evaluate the hexagon tile maps produced by the algorithm. The methods to evaluate the alternative displays have not been thoroughly explored in this thesis, but could be included as functions with the \texttt{R} implementation. This framework will be used to create relevant tests that contrast the use of the map area, and changes in the visual when the parameter of the hexagon tile map algorithm are altered.

The current hexagon tile map creates a template map that can be used to visualise any data set that contains the areas used to create the map. There is the possibility of allowing a bivariate display to incorporate uncertainty by using a colour scheme that operates in two directions, as suggested by Lucchesi and Wikle \autocite{VUADBC}.
The animation methods that allow the colours filling the hexagons to flicker to communicate the uncertainty around an estimate could also be employed.\\
With large hexagons, there is a potential to incorporate geofacets \autocite{IGF} to create a tessellated display of small visualisations for each geographic unit. These displays become increasingly complex if the visualisation becomes more detailed, or the hexagons become smaller.

The animations created of the Australian Statistical Areas at Level 2 highlight just how many SA2 areas are hidden due to their size in the choropleth display. This animation could be included future iterations of the Australian Cancer Atlas to improve the communication of the spatial distributions of the burden of cancer on Australian communities.

This work has contributed a new alternative visualisation method to highlight the communities in spatial data sets. This is valuable as the spatial distributions of cancer burden for different types of cancers largely relates to the population rather than the geography. It also contributes an algorithm to produce these displays for any set of spatial polygons. Through this thesis an open-source \texttt{R} package implementation has been inlcuded on the CRAN package respositiory, with associated examples and documentation for use by any \texttt{R} user.
This work has also contributed to the literature of visual inference studies, by using the ``lineup'' protocol developed by Buja et al.~and used by \textcite{GIIV}, and \textcite{GTPCCD}.
To communicate human related spatial patterns of disease, map creators should consider the use of alternative displays. The hexagon tile map display has proven effective in this thesis for communicating spatial distributions in sets of heterogeneous geographic units. This thesis provides a practical guide for map creators to communicate spatial displays of cancer data in Australia.

The detection rates for the NW-SE trend model was less varied than the detection rates for the Three Cities and All Cities trends. Fig. \ref{fig:pdetection-group} shows the distribution using a boxplot. This shows the distributions of the rates do not overlap for NW-SE and Three Cities trends, the Three cities range was larger, but the median was much higher for the NW-SE trend.

Each lineup had twelve map displays, this gave participants the choice of any plot, and the choice to not provide a response. this non-reponse is indicated by 0.
The choices made by participants are displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:choices}. The height of each orange lollipop indiates the proportion of participants that selected the map display of real data, they represent the correct choices.
The green lollipops show the proportion of participants that selected the incorrect displays in each lineup.

The proportion of choices are also presented separately for each trend model in Table. \ref{tab:choice-nwse}, Table. \ref{tab:choice-three}, and Table. \ref{tab:choice-all}.
The correct map display in lineups with a North West to South East trend was chosen correctly with much greater frequency.
In the lineups of All Cities displays, participants were misled by the choropleth display, but not the hexagon display for all except (2).
All of Three Cities displays, except (4), were detected in the hexagon display. All except one lineup had at least one participant select the correct map in the lineup as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:choices}.

Participants were recruited via advertising on the Figure Eight crowdsource platform.
Choosing the task from the list directed all potential participants to the page of instructions.
This page contained written instructions and is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:instruct}.

\hypertarget{survey-application}{%
\section{Survey application}\label{survey-application}}

The survey application was a \texttt{shinydashboard} we application, hosted on a website external to the Figure-Eight platform. The link to the survey was located at the bottom of the instructions and training page. Only participants who had read all of the instructions and seen the example image sets continued to the survey via the link.
This page also contained a question that asked participants for a validation code. The participants unique validation code was generated upon them opening the web application. This code was released to participants when they had considered all twelve lineups and submitted their responses to the \texttt{googlesheets} data set. Their validation codes were contained in the data set and associated with each of their responses.

The demographic and consent page of the \texttt{shinydashboard} web application are displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:survey-demogs}. Two example lineups are shown, one choropleth map lineup in Fig. \ref{fig:survey-choro} and one heaxgon tile map lineup in Fig. \ref{fig:survey-hex}.
