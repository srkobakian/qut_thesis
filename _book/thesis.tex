Relationships between geographic areas can be communicated using maps. The speed of visual processes allow quick comparisons to be made between neighbouring areas. However, when presenting population-related statistics on the geographic map base, large areas that draw readers' attention can allow too much emphasis to be placed on sparsely populated rural areas.
This problem can dramatically impact the interpretation of statistics across Australia, due to the large difference in the land area when the population is concentrated in a few small areas.

In this thesis a new algorithm for laying out spatial areas into a tessellated hexgon tile is developed. This layout is used to create a new visualisation method for displaying disease data for Australia.
An experiment was conducted that indicates that this visualisation outperforms the traditional choropleth map for communicating disease data.
A software implementation was generated and made publicly available for others to use these techniques. In addition, animation can be used to translate from the choropleth map to the new tessellated hexagon display to help viewers interpret the new display.

\hypertarget{ch:intro}{%
\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro}}

There are many visualisation methods used to present geospatial data. The design of the visualisation chosen can hinder or improve the communication of the spatial distribution. A choropleth map is the most common display used to present geographical data. Maps contribute to understanding spatial distributions of disease occurrence, and locating disease clusters. Disease data is often aggregated by political areas. One reason for this is privacy and another is the responsibility on the political entity to respond. The typical visualisation for aggregated spatial data is a choropleth map, where areas are coloured by the numerical value.

Choropleth maps do a disservice to the map reader, as the attention of the map user is distributed according to the size of the area. Using a choropleth map to get a broad perspective of Australia can be misleading, when the use of geographical areas misrepresents the spatial distribution of a dataset. This is not practical if each area is considered equally important. In Australia, the population is not equally dispersed across the geographic map base.
Instead, the communities are densely populated in the inner city areas, especially around the capital cities. There are several visualisation methods that have been developed to emphasise the population dense areas. These alternatives should be considered when planning the communication of geospatial statistics, visualisations should be chosen to best represent the spatial distribution. The work is motivated by the Australian Cancer Atlas,
which presents the spatial patterns of many cancers in Australia. The aim of this thesis is to contribute an algorithm that creates effective visualisations for the communication of geospatial population statistics.

\hypertarget{the-australian-cancer-atlas}{%
\section{The Australian Cancer Atlas}\label{the-australian-cancer-atlas}}

This work was motivated by the Australian Cancer Atlas (ACA), an online, interactive web tool for exploring the impact of cancer on Australian communities. The prominent display used by the ACA is a visualisation of incidence rates or excess death rates. The set of geographic units used is Australian Statistical Areas, at Level 2 (SA2s). There are almost 2,200 individual SA2s.

The choropleth map used in the ACA is familiar to the general public of Australia. It is appropriate to use this display as users can orient themselves on the map base and find geographic areas relevant to them.
However, when the intention of the map user is to convey the whole spatial distribution the information derived visually from the colours can be misleading.
The rural areas are over emphasised, and the densely populated inner city areas are not given enough attention.

\hypertarget{visual-inference}{%
\section{Visual Inference}\label{visual-inference}}

Visual inference will be used to determine if the communication of population geospatial statistics is more effective when using an alternative display.
Buja et al \autocite{GIIV} provide the `lineup' protocol as a formal framework for testing visual statistical methods. Implementing this framework will allow new alternative visualisation method to be tested.

The lineup protocol will be used to test if a visualisation is effective, a visualisation displaying a real population based distribution can be hidden in a collection of visualisations that display null distributions \autocite{chowd}.
It takes inspiration from a police lineup.
The witness in this regard is a participant recruited from a crowdsource platform, such as Figure-Eight.
The visualisation containing a real distribution is considered the `accused'.
It is put in a lineup of innocent displays that do not show a real population based distribution.
If the `witness' chooses the `accused' as different from the innocent plots, it can be considered that there is a specific pattern displayed that is not present in the others.
In this protocol, the null hypothesis can be rejected in favour of the alternative when it is chosen in the lineup. The null hypothesis fails to be rejected when it is not selected in the lineup.

\hypertarget{sec:aims}{%
\section{Aims and Objectives}\label{sec:aims}}

This work aims to provide a solution to presenting geospatial data regarding populations.
It considers the visualisation methods developed over the past two centuries that shift the focus from the geographic map base.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \emph{Devising an Algorithm for creating hexagon tile maps of Australia:} The algorithm will take geospatial areas and create an alternative visualisation of the spatial distribution.
\item
  \emph{Test the effectiveness of the hexagon tile map relative to the choropleth map:} The hexagon tile map produced by the algorithm will be contrasted with the traditional choropleth map, applying the same colour methods to represent the data. The maps will be used in an experiment to test the effectiveness by asking for users to spot spatial distributions.
\item
  \emph{Communicating the relationship between the hexmap and choropleth map through animation:} Maximise the benefits of both displays when communicating to the public. The use of animations may control how people follow a recognisable map of Australia into an alternative visualisation for inference.

The thesis is structured as follows: Chapter two contains a literature review.
The literature reviews considers the current peer reviewed literature and published books that explore spatial distributions of cancer across the globe.
It also considers how to evaluate the visualisation methods used for spatial data.

Chapter three explores the algorithm to create hexagon tile maps and the code used to create a small example of Tasmania in Australia.
Chapter four is a visual inference study that contains the methods and results that compare the use of a choropleth map and a hexagon tile map on the same data sets.
Chapter five provides a conclusion of the results of the visual inference study and how the hexagon tile map may be used in practice.

\hypertarget{ch:literature}{%
\chapter{Literature Review}\label{ch:literature}}

The following chapters in this thesis each contain an introductory section to introduce the relevant literature. This literature review chapter provides an overview of the key areas of interest in the literature that are relevant to this research. This chapter is organised as follows. Section 1 outlines the traditional spatial mapping technique, the choropleth map, and provides design inspiration using examples of online cancer atlases. Section 2 outlines contemporary mapping approaches, suggested as alternatives to the choropleth. Section 3 compares and critiques these alternative displays in light of the strengths and weaknesses of the choropleth method. section 4 considers how users interact with mapping displays in online cancer atlases, and how map creators can direct the attention of uses through animation.

This chapter was submitted for publication to the journal \emph{Annals of Cancer Epidemiology} for publication. This was intended for an audience of cancer atlas creators to be inspired by current atlases, and to encourage the pursuit of alternative displays.

The chapter introduces the step devised for the algorithm.
The chapter frames the steps in light of the \texttt{sugarbag} \autocite{sugarbag} package functions that allow users to enact the algorithm in \texttt{R} \autocite{R}. It uses the Statisical Areas of Australia at Level 2, taking a subset and considering only those located within the island of Tasmania.
It also provides an example of how to animate between the choropleth map display and the hexagon tile map.

This chapter tests the performance of the hexagon tile map display created using the algorithm discussed in \ref{ch:algorithm}.
It outlines the lineup protocol method of visual inference used to test information visualisations.
Using a two factor experimental design, the experiment contrasts the performance of participants when they viewed a choropleth map, and a hexagon tile map.
The contrast also involved three types of spatial trends, one geographic trend, and two population related distributions.
The results showed that participants did in fact more accurately find the population related distributions.

\hypertarget{ch:conclusion}{%
\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}}

Cancer Atlases are used to develop hypotheses about spatial distributions of cancer statistics \autocite{CPISACA}. However, the use of the choropleth map may lead to misinterpretation of the overall distribution. This is because of the overemphasis on the large geographic areas, and the lack of visibility for the small inner-city communities \autocite{ACTUC}.

The first aim of this thesis was to present an alternative visualisation method for spatial data. This thesis has provided a new algorithm to present spatial distributions of disease data, and includes an R code \autocite{R} implementation. The spatial data sets with population related distributions will be effectively communicated by this display. The hexagon tile map display will represent each area equally on the map space to effectively convey the spatial distribution. This does not require manual creation of layouts, and the displays are reusable for any data set that uses the same set of geographic units.

The second aim was to test effectiveness of the hexagon tile map relative to the choropleth map. It was expected that the familiar map base would have advantages in communicating geospatial distributions. However, when tested using the lineup protocol the results for the choropleth map and hexagon tile map were extrememly close. The hexagon tile map was much more effective for communicating the population related distributions.

To achieve the third aim of this thesis, the hexagon tile map output allows for animation between the choropleth display and the hexagon tile map display. This was acheived through the implementation of the \texttt{sugarbag} \autocite{sugarbag} package for R \autocite{R}.

The hexagon tile map visualisation method solves the misrepresentation problem of choropleth display. Especially for geographic data sets that contain a substantial amounts of areas. This algorithm is accessible to all \texttt{R} users, it can be applied to any set of areas in an \texttt{sf} \autocite{sf} object through the set of simple functions.
The tessellation employed in the hexagon tile map algorithm maintains connectedness between neighbouring areas, this draws inspiration from contiguous cartograms \autocite{ACA}, rectangular cartograms \autocite{RSCW} and Dorling's circular cartograms \autocite{ACTUC}. However, the hexagon tile map algorithm does not employ the gravitation pull mathematics that is used to create contiguous cartograms. It also does not iterate on the placement of hexagons. The choice of a consistent shape to be used for all areas draws from rectangular and Dorling cartograms. This encourages map readers to focus on the similarities or difference in the colour between geographic neighbours, and does not distract them with unfamiliar boundaries produced during a contiguous cartogram transformation.

The effectiveness of the hexagon tile map has been proved by the visual inference study. It showed that participants could recognise the data display in the set of null distributions more frequently when viewing a hexagon tile map display. The choropleth map display is still effective for distributions that are directly related to the geography, such as the North-West to South-East distribution used in the study. This has expanded the applications of visual inference studies in a spatial data context by contributing a specific example of testing new graphical displays for geospatial data.

The tile map allocation provided by the algorithm can easily be used to create animations between a choropleth and hexagon tile map display. Linking the familiar geography to the effective display for understanding the distribution across many heterogeneous geographic regions. Many interactive tools are included in current cancer atlases, these additions allow user driven exploration, but do not guarantee that the spatial distribution across the geographic space is digested accurately.
Animating between a choropleth and a hexagon tile map will allows map users to understand how the small communities of a whole country are affected simultaneously. It also teaches map users how to find areas of interest as their attention is drawn to the capital cities, that may not have caught their attention in the display of the choropleth map. When communicating cancer statistics, there should be a balance between providing people a familiar landscape and ensuring the interpret the spatial distribution correctly. Animations will communicate a specific message through the capture and direction of users' attention.

Future work will include expanding on the criteria used to evaluate the hexagon tile maps produced by the algorithm. The methods to evaluate the alternative displays have not been thoroughly explored in this thesis, but could be included as functions with the \texttt{R} implementation. This framework will be used to create relevant tests that contrast the use of the map area, and changes in the visual when the parameter of the hexagon tile map algorithm are altered.

The current hexagon tile map creates a template map that can be used to visualise any data set that contains the areas used to create the map. There is the possibility of allowing a bivariate display to incorporate uncertainty by using a colour scheme that operates in two directions, as suggested by Lucchesi and Wikle \autocite{VUADBC}.
The animation methods that allow the colours filling the hexagons to flicker to communicate the uncertainty around an estimate could also be employed.\\
With large hexagons, there is a potential to incorporate geofacets \autocite{IGF} to create a tessellated display of small visualisations for each geographic unit. These displays become increasingly complex if the visualisation becomes more detailed, or the hexagons become smaller.

The animations created of the Australian Statistical Areas at Level 2 highlight just how many SA2 areas are hidden due to their size in the choropleth display. This animation could be included future iterations of the Australian Cancer Atlas to improve the communication of the spatial distributions of the burden of cancer on Australian communities.

This work has contributed a new alternative visualisation method to highlight the communities in spatial data sets. This is valuable as the spatial distributions of cancer burden for different types of cancers largely relates to the population rather than the geography. It also contributes an algorithm to produce these displays for any set of spatial polygons. Through this thesis an open-source \texttt{R} package implementation has been inlcuded on the CRAN package respositiory, with associated examples and documentation for use by any \texttt{R} user.
This work has also contributed to the literature of visual inference studies, by using the ``lineup'' protocol developed by Buja et al.~and used by \textcite{GIIV}, and \textcite{GTPCCD}.
To communicate human related spatial patterns of disease, map creators should consider the use of alternative displays. The hexagon tile map display has proven effective in this thesis for communicating spatial distributions in sets of heterogeneous geographic units. This thesis provides a practical guide for map creators to communicate spatial displays of cancer data in Australia.

The detection rate is considered for each lineup. The detection rates for group A were less varied than the detection rates for the lineups seen by group B. Fig. \ref{fig:pdetection-group} shows the distribution using a boxplot. This shows the median value for detection rate was extremely similar.

The overall detection rate is considered for each trend model in Fig. \ref{fig:pdetect-trend}.
The detection rates for the NW-SE trend model was less varied than the detection rates for the Three Cities and All Cities trends. Fig. \ref{fig:pdetection-group} shows the distribution using a boxplot. This shows the distributions of the rates do not overlap for NW-SE and Three Cities trends, the Three cities range was larger, but the median was much higher for the NW-SE trend. The All Cities trend model distribution overlaps with the NW-SE and All Cities trends.

The boxplots in Fig. \ref{fig:pdetection-type} contrast the distribution of the detection rates for eah type of display.
The detection rates across the lineups was less varied for the hexagon display. There was a large difference in the medians for the types of displays.
Without considering the relationship for each lineup, the hexagon lineup display allowed the participants to achieve higher detection rates.

Each lineup had twelve map displays, this gave participants the choice of any plot, and the choice to not provide a response. this non-reponse is indicated by 0.
The choices made by participants are displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:choices}. The height of each orange lollipop indiates the proportion of participants that selected the map display of real data, they represent the correct choices.
The green lollipops show the proportion of participants that selected the incorrect displays in each lineup.

The proportion of choices are also presented separately for each trend model in Table. \ref{tab:choice-nwse}, Table. \ref{tab:choice-three}, and Table. \ref{tab:choice-all}.
The correct map display in lineups with a North West to South East trend was chosen correctly with much greater frequency.
In the lineups of All Cities displays, participants were misled by the choropleth display, but not the hexagon display for all except (2).
All of Three Cities displays, except (4), were detected in the hexagon display. All except one lineup had at least one participant select the correct map in the lineup as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:choices}.

Participants were recruited via advertising on the Figure-Eight crowdsource platform.
Choosing the task from the list directed all potential participants to the page of instructions.
This page contained written instructions and is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:instruct}.

\hypertarget{survey-application}{%
\section{Survey application}\label{survey-application}}

The survey application was a \texttt{shinydashboard} we application, hosted on a website external to the Figure-Eight platform. The link to the survey was located at the bottom of the instructions and training page. Only participants who had read all of the instructions and seen the example image sets continued to the survey via the link.
This page also contained a question that asked participants for a validation code. The participants unique validation code was generated upon them opening the web application. This code was released to participants when they had considered all twelve lineups and submitted their responses to the \texttt{googlesheets} data set. Their validation codes were contained in the data set and associated with each of their responses.

The demographic and consent page of the \texttt{shinydashboard} web application are displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:survey-demogs}. Two example lineups are shown, one choropleth map lineup in Fig. \ref{fig:survey-choro} and one heaxgon tile map lineup in Fig. \ref{fig:survey-hex}.
