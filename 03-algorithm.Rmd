# An algorithm for creating a tessellated hexagon display {#ch:algorithm}

This chapter relates to the first research aim as stated in \ref{sec:aims}.
The chapter introduces the step devised for the algorithm.
The chapter frames the steps in light of the `sugarbag` [@sugarbag] package functions that allow users to enact the algorithm in `R` [@R]. It uses the Statisical Areas of Australia at Level 2, taking a subset and considering only those located within the island of Tasmania.
It also provides an example of how to animate between the choropleth map display and the hexagon tile map.


This chapter was submitted for publication to the *Journal of Statistical Software* for publication. 
The steps in this algorithm are implemented in the `sugarbag` [@sugarbag] package for `R` [@R].
