This thesis contributes to improvements in effectively communicating population related cancer distributions and the associated burden of cancer on Australian communities. This thesis presents a new algorithm for creating an alternative map displays of tessellating hexagons. Alternative map displays can emphasise statistics in countries that contain densely populated cities. It is accompanied by a software implementation that automates the choice of one hexagon to represent each geographic unit, ensuring the statistic for each is equitably presented. The case study comparing a traditional choropleth map to the alternative hexagon tile map contributes to a growing field of visual inference studies.
