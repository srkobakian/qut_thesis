# Abstract {-}


<!--less than 500 words-->
Relationships between geographic areas can be communicated using maps. The speed of visual processes allow quick comparisons to be made between neighbouring areas. However, when presenting population-related statistics on the geographic map base, large areas that draw readers' attention can allow too much emphasis to be placed on sparsely populated rural areas.
This problem can dramatically impact the interpretation of statistics across Australia, due to the large difference in the land area when the population is concentrated in a few small areas.


In this thesis a new algorithm for laying out spatial areas into a tessellated hexgon tile is developed. This layout is used to create a new visualisation method for displaying disease data for Australia.
An experiment was conducted that indicates that this visualisation outperforms the traditional choropleth map for communicating disease data.
A software implementation was generated and made publicly available for others to use these techniques. In addition, animation can be used to translate from the choropleth map to the new tessellated hexagon display to help viewers interpret the new display.
