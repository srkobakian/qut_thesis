The atlas designs are evaluated on the basis of map design recommendations from cartographers and from a series of cognitive experiments on information extraction from rate maps. Despite some design limitations, the atlases adequately described patterns of U.S. mortality data, resulting in important etiologic findings and action to reduce cancer rates and health disparities."

The topic is of increasing interest to statisticians, though much groundwork has been done by epidemiologists and medical geographers. Methods for the detection and testing for apparent clusters of disease, including those near a possible environmental hazard, are reviewed. Estimating regional mortality rates, possibly to construct disease maps, and methods for investigating the association between disease rates and social, demographic and environmental factors are discussed. In addition, statistical analysis of the spatial spread of epidemics is mentioned.},
